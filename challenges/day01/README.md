# Day 01 – Complexity as a compass

On the first day of the journey, we are recalling a memory from the very first day of 2024, where we fought primitives.

This year, we are starting differently and seeing where we arrive...

## Challenge — Use complexity metrics to guide your refactoring

Today, you will install a complexity plugin or tool to help you measure the complexity of your code. You will then use it to drive refactoring actions on your code.

## Where to play

Pick the stack you want to use as your **main stack** this year and open the Day 1 memory from 2024, or warming up with the exercise from Day 1 of 2023 instead.

| Mode              | Memory                                         | Suggested for…                           |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 🧭 **Standard**   | `memories/2024/exercises/<your-stack>/day01`  | Using complexity as a compass on a richer method |
| 🟢 **Very easy**  | `memories/2023/exercises/<your-stack>/day01`  | Warming up with a smaller, lighter kata  |

Let the journey begin ➰💫
